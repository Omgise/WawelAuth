/**
 * Metadata for a texture file stored on disk.
 *
 * Textures are stored using content-addressed storage: the filename is the
 * content hash of the PNG file. This deduplicates identical textures across
 * profiles automatically.
 *
 * The hash is also placed in the texture URL path, which Minecraft uses for
 * client-side cache keying (per the Yggdrasil spec, the hash is the substring
 * after the last '/' in the texture URL).
 *
 * Storage layout: {stateDir}/textures/{hash}.png
 *
 * Security: uploaded textures must be validated and re-encoded before storage
 * to prevent PNG bombs and metadata-based exploits (see spec).
