/**
 * Data access interface for {@link PendingSession} entries.
 *
 * Manages the short-lived join/hasJoined handshake state.
 * Implementations may be in-memory (recommended, since sessions are ephemeral
 * and expire in seconds) or persistent.
 *
 * Used by:
 * - POST /sessionserver/session/minecraft/join (create)
 * - GET /sessionserver/session/minecraft/hasJoined (consume)
 *
 * Sessions are one-time use: consumed by hasJoined and then deleted.
 * Sessions expire after a configurable timeout (typically 15-30 seconds).
 *
 * Sessions are keyed by serverId alone. Each connection attempt produces a unique
 * serverId (SHA-1 hash of server ID string + shared secret + server public key),
 * so there is at most one pending session per serverId at any time.
